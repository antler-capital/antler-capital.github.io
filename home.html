    <p>“2020 is the year when things are really expected to fall off the cliff but it may happen before,” said Antler Capital Partners LLP founder Georges Gedeon.</p>
    <p>Gedeon knows a thing or two about falling credit cycles. The former investor at London-based GLG Partners Inc. amassed shorts on overleveraged companies at the peak of the financial crisis, spinning double-digit returns in its wake.

   <p>For trader Georges Gedeon, it’s just what he’s been waiting for: a debt-laden buyout like he saw on the eve of the global financial crisis.</p>
   <p>Danish phone company TDC A/S is being taken over by a group of pension funds -- a deal that’s likely to push its investment-grade rating to junk, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Aidan Cheslin.</p>
   <p>It’s red meat for Gedeon, a former Millennium Management trader who started Antler Capital Partners in December, aiming to capitalize on the rising distress he anticipates from a wave of late-cycle leveraged buyouts.

   <p>London-based Antler Capital Partners, which he founded in December after leaving Izzy Englander’s famed hedge fund, will tap event-driven credit strategies to bet on or against companies that become stressed or targeted in takeovers.

In all cases, we will ensure service providers are fully compliant with GDPR ahead of transferring any personal data.</li>
    </ul></pre>
  <br/>
  <h2>WHAT PERSONAL DATA DOES THE FIRM COLLECT AND WHY?</h2>
  <p>In the course of providing products/services to you, the Firm may collect information that is considered personal information (e.g. name, contact details, address, passport number, driving licence).</p>
  <p>As a client, contact or employee of Antler Capital, we will require some personal information in order to verify your identity and have the applicable relationship with you. Some of this information may be required to satisfy legal obligations (e.g. to comply with obligations arising under the money laundering regulations whereas other information may be required in connection with the provision of services to you). The information collected will vary depending on the service the Firm provides to you or you provide to the Firm, but typically includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information: Such as your name, date of birth, passport number or national insurance number;</li>
    <li>Contact information: Including your address, telephone number and email address.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h2>WHERE DOES THE FIRM STORE MY PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
  <p>The Firm has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to ensure your personal data is kept safe and secure, with these including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data encryption;</li>
    <li>Firewalls;</li>

  </ul>
  
  <br/><h2>HOW LONG DOES THE FIRM RETAIN PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
  <p>As a regulated entity, the Firm is required to maintain its books and records for a prescribed period (five years from either the ceasing of a business relationship, or, in the case of non-clients, from the making of a record – or alternatively, for seven years, where specifically requested to do so by the Financial Conduct Authority). As such, information that falls in scope of either of these requirements is retained in line with the mandated timeframe. </p>
  <p>Any information that is outside the scope of this requirement will be retained whilst relevant and useful, and destroyed where this ceases to be the case or where the data subject specifically requests this.</p>
  
  <br/><h2>HOW HAVE I BEEN CATEGORISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GDPR?</h2>
  <p>The GDPR requires the Firm to inform you of the legal basis on which we maintain your personal data. Typically, the Firm will reach out to you personally to confirm this; however, as a general rule the following is applicable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clients – Information is maintained on the basis of contractual obligation and/or legitimate interests (where relevant);</li>
    <li>Service providers – Information is maintained on the basis of contractual obligation; and</li>
    <li>Database/marketing contacts – Information is maintained on the basis of legitimate interest.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>You have the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some, or all, of your personal information, please email the Firm at amallet@antler-capital.com . The Firm will provide this information to you within one month (with the ability to extend this by an additional two months where necessary), free of charge.</li>
    <li>You have the right to request that the information the Firm holds about you is erased under certain circumstances including where there is no additional legal and/or regulatory requirement for the Firm to retain this information.</li>
    <li>As a client, you have the right to request that any information the Firm holds about you be provided to another company in a commonly used and machine-readable format, otherwise known as ‘data portability’.</li>
    <li>You have the right to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date, or where necessary rectified. Where you feel that your personal data is incorrect or inaccurate and should therefore be updated, please contact amallet@antler-capital.com.</li>
